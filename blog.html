                <p>
                    Debugging is important because it allows software engineers and developers to fix errors in a
                    program before releasing it to the public. It's a complementary process to testing, which involves
                    learning how an error affects a program overall. Debugging allows to run your code step by step in a
                    debugging tool like Visual Studio and chrome devtool, to find the exact point where you made a
                    programming mistake. You
                    understand what corrections you need to make in your code and debugging tools often allow you
                    to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program. <br>
                    <b>Here are the some question what you have to must know as a web-developer :</b>

                <p>
                    The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or
                    local storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.
                    <br>
                    <b>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
                    <li>The values stored may only be strings.</li>
                    <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
