                </h3>

                <p>
                    Debugging is important because it allows software engineers and developers to fix errors in a
                    program before releasing it to the public. It's a complementary process to testing, which involves
                    learning how an error affects a program overall. Debugging allows to run your code step by step in a
                    debugging tool like Visual Studio and chrome devtool, to find the exact point where you made a
                    programming mistake. You
                    understand what corrections you need to make in your code and debugging tools often allow you
                    to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program. <br>

                <h3 class="pt-4 text-primary">Differences between local storage and session storage?</h3>

                <p>
                    The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or
                    local storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data items.
                    <br>
                    <b>localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
                    <li>The values stored may only be strings.</li>
                    <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
                </ul> <br>
                <b>The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date:</b> <br>
                <br>
                <b>localStorage </b>persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a
                new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration. <br>
                <b>sessionStorage</b> is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or
                the browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and
                new storage.

                <h3 class="pt-4 text-primary">Differences between global scope and block scope?</h3>

                <p>
                    In a browser environment, the <b>global scope</b> is controlled by the window object while in Node.
                    js, it's controlled by the global object.<b>Block scopes</b> are what you get when you use if
                    statements, for statements, and the like. <br>
                    <b>Global Level Scope:</b> In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that
                    contains,
                    and is visible in, all other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the
                    web page inside which all the code is being executed. <br>
                    <b>Block Level Scope:</b> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific
                    block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to
                    be block scoped.

                <h3 class="pt-4 text-primary">How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h3>

                <p>
                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the
                    code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite
                    different from models in other languages like C and Java.The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to
                    monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will
                    take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs
                    it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variable that is not initialized will given undefined</li>
                    <li>Function with no return</li>
                    <li>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
                    <li>If return has nothing on the right side ,will return undefined</li>
                    <li>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined</li>
                    <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range</li>
                    <li>Deleting an array inside an array</li>
                    <li>Set a value directly to undefined</li>
                </ul>
